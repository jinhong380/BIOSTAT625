# BIOSTAT625 - Final Project Group 8

This is **WEEK 12**

The schedule rmd will be updated weekly, please check for any project updates.\
Please work on **individual coding files** whenever possible. **Merging** might fail.

## Data Processing: (100%)

1. Please turn all pre-processed datasets into CSV files, and upload the dataset and code to the folder "data_exploration". *(finished)* 

2. The processed whole data set is named as "housing_cleaned_price.csv", with price outliers deleted.
  
   The "housing_cleaned_Price+Carpet.csv" deleted the outliers for both carpet area and price.
   
   *p.s. the previous version of "housing_cleaned.csv" could could be reproduced with datasets within the Data section (remember to change the path before import the datasets) using Total_data.ipynb.*

5. The final version of the cleaned datasets with location properly clustered by economic status is stored in the "Data Exploration" folder
   
   1) **housing_cleaned_final.csv**
      
      path: Data Exploration/housing_cleaned_final.csv;
      
      Description: with missing values.
      
   3) file name **housing_rmna_cleaned_final.csv**

      path: Data Exploration/housing_rmna_cleaned_final.csv;

      Description: with no missing value.

      Special Reminder: The 'Transaction', 'Total Floors','location','State', 'Current Floor', 'Carpet Area' variables can be deleted when conducting the modeling process as they are either transformed to categorical variable or already conducted one-hot encoding and turned to other variables.
