Week 8
-Figuring out appropriate dataset to analyze, looking at size, complexity, ability to analyze in semester-long project

Week 9
-cannot push the dataset itself to Github, it’s too large
-need to convert objects in raw dataset to numerical or categorical variables
-conversion of variables depending on figuring out the "real world" meaning of each variable
  -examples: number of bathrooms, covered or uncovered parking
-many variables in data, more difficult to do linear regression, more likely that machine learning will work better
-handling missing values
-deciding between trying to predict variable “amount” or “price” 
	-“amount” depends on common areas that we don't have much data for, so we decided on "price"
