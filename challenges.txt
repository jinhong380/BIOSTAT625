-Figuring out appropriate dataset to analyze, looking at size, complexity, ability to analyze
-cannot push the dataset itself to Github, itâ€™s too large
-need to convert objects in raw dataset to numerical or categorical variables
-conversion of variables depending on figuring out the "real world" meaning of each variable
-many variables in data, more difficult to do linear regression, more likely that machine learning will work better
-handling missing values
