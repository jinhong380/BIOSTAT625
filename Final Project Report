(includes Data Cleaning/Preparation)
-We deleted the variable "Status" because there were too many missing values and because it was not related to the listed home price.
-We deleted the variable "Total Floors" because it was highly correlated with "Current Floor" (corr = 0.73) and we wanted to avoid multicollinearity.
