## Project Deadlines:

Project Proposal - Nov.22nd/ Week 13

Presentation - Week 15

Report Deadline - Week 16

## Group Rules:

1.  Having regular weekly group meeting to check the progress of the
    project, resolve potential issues, and determine the plan and
    distribution of assignments for next week.
2.  The schedule will update regularly after the meetings; please check
    the schedule to for any updates of the project.
3.  Please update any changes to the main code and report in the group
    chat (WhatsApp).

## Group meeting time:

Regular meeting time: Wednesday at 1pm\
Next meeting time: Wednesday 1pm, Week 9

## Project Progress:

Week 7:

1.  Decided the dataset and topic of project (housing data, to predict
    the housing price with given variables)
2.  Decided the weekly meeting time (Wed. 1 pm, sph I).
3.  Assigned work for week 8.

Week 8:

1.  Checked variables and we decided to use the following variables:\
    Prices (dependent variable)/ location/ Carpet Area/ Status/ Floor/
    Transaction/ Furnishing/ facing/ overlooking/ Bathroom/ Balcony/ Car
    Parking/ Onwership/

2.  Decided to use modelling methods: 1. elastic net; 2. Random Forest;

Week 9:

1.  Data Cleaning:
    -   Keep all missing values and we will put them all together next
        Tuesday;

    -   For elastic net, we might want to delete the extreme values and
        using numeric version of Bathroom and Balcony; for random
        forest, we would just keep the extreme values and using
        categorical Bathroom and Balcony;
2.  Data Modeling:
    -   Jennifer/ Sihan: elastic net

    -   Jintong/ Wenjie: random forest
3.  Extra Information Search (for location) - either income or tax
    -   we want to use clustering for elastic net when processing the
        location variable.

## Weekly Schedule:

**Week 7 - Project Start**

1.  Find optimal datasets and topic/models for the project -- Everyone;
2.  Determine the next group meeting time. -- Everyone send an optimal
    time to the group chat;
3.  Determine the programming language will be using for the project --
    Python;
4.  Adding group members to github and check if all member can access
    the repository -- Please report any problem in the group chat;
5.  Rough plans for rest of the semester -- Sheryl;

**Week 8 - Data expoloration/ Data cleaning**

Everyone:

1.  Data exploration.
2.  Coding for categorical data.
3.  Check if there's any weird things about the dataset itself.
4.  Find models we can use.

**Week 9 - Data expoloration/ Data cleaning / Start simple data
modeling**

1.  Check extreme values/data patterns/ create plot (scatter for
    numerical/ barplot for categorical) for each variables/ Do one hot
    encoding for categorical variables (not for location)/ normalizing
    the numerical variables if possible (create a separate column for
    this). Please refer to following link for more information of
    normalization (more info can also be found in ppt sent during our
    week 8 meeting):

    <https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/normalization-in-machine-learning>

    -   Sihan: Prices (dependent variable)/ location/ Carpet Area

    -   Jintong: status/ Floor/ Transaction

    -   Jennifer: Furnishing/ facing/ overlooking

    -   Haven: Bathroom/ Balcony/ Car Parking/ Onwership

2.  Do data cleaning for the missing values (imputations) - optional

3.  Do some research on the models (1. Elastic net; 2. Random Forest) -
    Everyone

**Week 10 - Data modeling preparation**

1.  Upload all cleaned variables and corresponding graphs before next
    Tuesdays meeting - **Everyone**
2.  Indian location income search - **Wenjie**
3.  Write simple sketch for:
    -   introduction (background information of housing& purpose of the
        modeling) - **Jennifer**

    -   data cleaning (**Everyone**) + how we are going to separate the
        datasets to testing and training set - **Wenjie +** Clustering
        methods used for location (**Jintong/** write for both Isolation
        Forest or Local Outlier Factor (LOF))

    -   modeling methods (random forest/elastic net) - each group write
        their own version of modeling methods and we will put them
        together next week during the meeting. â€“ **Everyone**

    -   how we are going to test the accuracy of the predictions (cross
        validation) - **Sihan**

    -   references if used any - **Everyone**

**Week 11 - Write proposal draft/ Start final report (introduction)/
Data modeling**

1.  Writing proposal: (On Google Document)

-   Data exploration - Jintong
-   Random Forest - Jintong Hevan
-   Elastic Net - Jennifer Sihan
-   Accuracy Test - Sihan

2.  Do further one hot encoding for facing/furnishing/overlooking -
    Jintong
3.  Upload the complete dataset to github - Jintong
4.  Do clustering if possible (optional) - Sihan

**Week 12 - Revise proposal/ Model testing/ final report (data summary,
modeling method)**

**Week 13 - Finalize and submit proposal (Nov.22nd, Fri.)/ Writing final
report (result)**

**Week 14 - Finalize code/ Prepare for presentation (power point,
presenter, etc.)/ Revising final report (conclusion, abstract)**

**Week 15 - Presentation/ Finalize report (references)**

**Week 16 - Wrap up and Submit the Final Report and Code**
