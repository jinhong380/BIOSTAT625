simple sketch/outline:

intro:
-Dataset of interest: house prices in India.
-When people sell homes, they have to decide what to set the starting house price at, but the true "value" of a home is based on many factors.
-Our goal is to predict house prices by using attributes of the home (such as location, floor area, or number of balconies).
-Using two different models (Elastic Net and Random Forest) to compare against each other and see which one works better.

Elastic Net:
-Elastic Net is a regression method.
